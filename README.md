## KiCad library for MakeDevice virtual modules

This KiCad library contains both symbols and footprints for the virtual Jacdac
modules `Gerber sockets`.

`Gerber sockets` are the endpoints, at which the MakeDevice application will
route the electrical traces. As of now, there are only `Jacdac bus` sockets, 
but in the future work we will follow with `Jacdac prog` sockets, as well.

A guide will follow soon to describe how to use this library, and how to 
create your own MakeDevice virtual modules.
